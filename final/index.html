                    <p>In lower income Baltimore neighborhoods, there tend to be more liquor stores within walking
                        distance rather than grocery stores, according to data from the city.
                    </p>
                    <p>This contributes to the greater food desert problem that the city faces. The Baltimore City
                        Health Department defines a food desert as an area more than a ¼ mile distance to a supermarket,
                        median household income at or below the federal poverty level and where 30% of households do not
                        own a vehicle. The federal poverty line for a household of four is $27,750, according to ASPE.
                    </p>
                    <p>These food deserts also disproportionately affect minority groups. For a city that is 57% Black,
                        minority communities make up a large percent of these minority communities while white people
                        live in the higher income areas, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance.
                    </p>
                    <p>For an area like Sandtown and Harlem Park, the average per capita income for 2020 was $16,694.
                        There are nine liquor stores in these neighborhoods, some only a block away from each other,
                        while there are no grocery stores.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The closest grocery for these residents is a Save A Lot in Upton, which is only a five minute
                        drive. However 62.3% of households do not own a vehicle, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood
                        Indicator Alliance, making the five minute drive a 20 minute walk.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Grocery store chains are hesitant to put stores in these impoverished areas out of concerns of
                        actually making a profit, according to the Baltimore Sun. Some commonly found stores in or
                        closer to lower income neighborhoods are Save a Lots, Safeways and smaller chain stores.
                    </p>

                    <p> An abundance of liquor stores being congregated in an area can also cause problems for the
                        neighborhood. A large concentration of stores that sell chilled or large quantities of alcohol,
                        such as 40 ounce cans, can lead to more public drunkenness, automobile crashes and violence,
                        according to a John Hopkins study. The same study shows that having such behavior in poor Black
                        neighborhoods can have damaging effects on the youth’s perceptions of alcohol consumption.</p>
                    <p>Too many liquor stores also leads to people drinking in public, which causes them to litter,
                        urinate and vomit on the streets, according to Capital News Service. Madison-Eastend has an
                        average per capita income of 17,331 for 2020 and a 340.7 rate of dirty streets and alley reports
                        per 1,000 residents, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance. The area also
                        has two liquor stores in proximity and one Save a Lot.
                    </p>
                    <p>John Hopkins also found that areas that have more liquor stores also have higher rates of crime
                        and violence, with every 10% increase in liquor store access leads to a 4.2% increase in violent
                        crime. For Sandtown, with the large number of liquor stores, the violent crime rate per 1,000
                        residents is at 30, which is the 4th highest in the city. The highest is Downtown and Seton
                        Hill, according to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicator Alliance.</p>
