            <h2>Company overview</h2>
            <p>Starbucks was founded in 1971 by Jerry Baldwin, Zev Siegl, and Gordon Bowker at Seattle's Pike Place
                Market.
                During the early 1980s, they sold the company to Howard Schultz who – after a business trip to Milan,
                Italy
                – decided to convert the coffee bean store into a coffee shop serving espresso-based drinks. As chief
                executive officer from 1986 to 2000, Schultz's first tenure led to an aggressive expansion of the
                franchise,
                first in Seattle, then across the West Coast of the United States. Schultz was succeeded by Orin Smith
                who
                ran the company for five years and positioned Starbucks as a large player in fair trade coffee,
                increasing
                sales to US$5 billion. Jim Donald served as chief executive officer from 2005 to 2008, orchestrating a
                large-scale earnings expansion. Schultz returned as CEO during the financial crisis of 2007–08 and spent
                the
                succeeding decade growing the company's market share, expanding its offerings, and reorienting the brand
                around corporate social responsibility. Kevin Johnson, the current CEO, succeeded Schultz in 2017. In
                March
                2022, Starbucks announced that Schultz would return as CEO in April 2022.</p>

            <h2>Locations</h2>
            <p>The company's headquarters is in Seattle, Washington, United States, where 3,501 people worked as of
                January
                2015.[138] The main building in the Starbucks complex was previously a Sears distribution center.<br>

                <br> As of September 2020, Starbucks had already operating 32,660 locations spanning 79 countries and
                territories on six continents:[139]
            </p>
            <h3>International Expansion</h3>
            <h4>Europe</h4>
            <p>In 1998, Starbucks entered the United Kingdom market with the US$83 million acquisition of the then
                56-outlet, UK-based Seattle Coffee Company, re-branding all those stores as Starbucks. <br>

                <br> In October 2002, Starbucks established a coffee trading company in Lausanne, Switzerland, to handle
                purchases of green coffee.[147] All other coffee-related business continued to be managed from
                Seattle.[147]<br>

                <br>In September 2007, the company opened its first store in Russia, ten years after first registering a
                trademark there.[148] After the Russian invasion of Ukraine, on 21 May 2022, Starbucks announced closure
                of
                all outlets in Russia,[149] and in July it was revealed that a local restaurant manager, Anton Pinsky,
                is
                going to acquire Starbucks' Russian operating company OOO Starbucks and all its 130 stores.[150]
