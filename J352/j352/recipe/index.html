    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Buffalo Chicken Dip has been a favorite of mine for years, and now that I can make my Buffalo Chicken Dip in a
        Crock Pot I can’t wait for the next party!
    <p> </p> Chicken, cream cheese, cheddar cheese, ranch dressing, and spicy buffalo sauce all go into the Crock Pot
    and a few hours later you have a creamy, spicy, perfectly dip-able buffalo chicken dip. It’s the appetizer version
    of my favorite crockpot buffalo chicken and it disappears at parties!!<p> </p> Ever since I discovered crockpot
    Buffalo Chicken Dip it’s been my go-to appetizer for parties, potlucks, and pretty much anytime I can find an excuse
    to make it. <p> </p> The creamy, cheesy, dip has just the right amount of spice from the buffalo sauce and it’s
    perfect for scooping up on a crisp tortilla chip, or a crunchy piece of celery.</p>
